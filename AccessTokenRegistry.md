# 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis: `AccessTokenRegistry.sol`

This contract manages access levels for users, with admin controls and a global threshold system. While it appears clean and functional, it contains several vulnerabilities that could compromise access integrity and control.

## 📋 Summary of Vulnerabilities

| Line(s) | Type                    | Description |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 34     | Access Control Flaw     | `toggleOverride()` lacks `onlyAdmin` modifier. |
| 38     | Access Control Flaw     | `transferAdmin()` lacks `onlyAdmin`—anyone can seize control. |
| 21     | Logic Flaw              | `assignAccess()` allows level 0, which may unintentionally grant access. |
| 27     | Logic Flaw              | `hasAccess()` trusts `overrideMode` without caller context. |
| 30     | Privilege Escalation    | `selfUpgrade()` allows users to increase their own access level. |
| 30     | Missing Rate Limiting   | No cooldown or cost for self-upgrade—can be spammed. |

## 🧨 Detailed Breakdown

### 1. `toggleOverride()` — Access Control Flaw
```solidity
function toggleOverride() external {
    overrideMode = !overrideMode;
}


- Issue: No access restriction—anyone can enable global access.
- Impact: All users gain access regardless of level.
- Severity: High.

2. transferAdmin() — Access Control Flaw
function transferAdmin(address newAdmin) external {
    registryAdmin = newAdmin;
}


- Issue: No onlyAdmin modifier—anyone can reassign admin.
- Impact: Complete loss of control.
- Severity: Critical.

3. assignAccess() — Logic Flaw
require(level <= 10, "Level too high");
accessLevels[user] = level;


- Issue: Allows level 0, which may be interpreted as valid access.
- Impact: Misconfigured access logic.
- Severity: Low to Medium.

4. hasAccess() — Logic Flaw
if (overrideMode) return true;


- Issue: Override applies to all users, including malicious ones.
- Impact: No granularity or caller context.
- Severity: Medium.

5. selfUpgrade() — Privilege Escalation
accessLevels[msg.sender] = newLevel;


- Issue: Users can increase their own access level.
- Impact: Bypasses admin control.
- Severity: High.

6. selfUpgrade() — Missing Rate Limiting
- Issue: No cost, cooldown, or validation logic.
- Impact: Users can spam upgrades or brute-force access.
- Severity: Medium.

✅ Suggested Fixes
- Add onlyAdmin to toggleOverride() and transferAdmin().
- Validate minimum access level in assignAccess() (e.g., disallow level 0).
- Refactor hasAccess() to include caller context or role-based override.
- Restrict or remove selfUpgrade()—or add cost, cooldown, and audit logging.
